# Mock-Health-Company
This is a mock-up of a MySQL database for a healthcare company, particulary reating to health finance.

It consists of seven tables 
  - members
  - providers
  - pharmacies
  - states
  - procedures
  - drugs
  - procedure_claims
  
 The articifical dataset for the database was created in Python by generating it from scratch, scraping from webpages,
 and downloading web files.

I have included a few SQL queries in the 'queries.sql' file to determine the performance of the company in a few healthcare quality areas.
